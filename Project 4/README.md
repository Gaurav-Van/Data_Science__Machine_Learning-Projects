# Customized DL Model for Alzheimers Detection from MRI Images

**This Project Aims to Develop a Customized Deep Learning Model which Detects 4 Classes of Alzheimer (Non Demented,
Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented and Moderate Demented) from MRI Images. The goal is to improve early detection and
diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using non-invasive and accessible imaging technology**
